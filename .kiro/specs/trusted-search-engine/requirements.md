# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a custom search engine that provides Google-like functionality while restricting results to trusted, high-authority sources. The system will index and search only verified sources such as Wikipedia, Britannica, academic databases, and institutional websites. The search engine will prioritize source credibility, relevance, and user intent understanding through advanced ranking algorithms and semantic search capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to search for information across trusted sources only, so that I can find reliable and credible information without having to filter through unreliable content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL return results exclusively from pre-approved trusted sources
2. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL show the original source name and type for each result
3. WHEN a user clicks on a search result THEN the system SHALL redirect them directly to the original source URL
4. IF no results are found in trusted sources THEN the system SHALL display a clear "no results found" message with suggestions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use advanced search filters, so that I can narrow down results by source type, publication date, and topic categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the search interface THEN the system SHALL provide filter options for source type (Wikipedia, Academic, Government, etc.)
2. WHEN applying date filters THEN the system SHALL only show results within the specified date range
3. WHEN selecting topic filters THEN the system SHALL categorize and filter results by subject area
4. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL combine all filter criteria using AND logic
5. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL reset to show all available results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want intelligent search results that understand my intent, so that I receive relevant information even when my query is ambiguous or uses different terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL use semantic search to understand query intent
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL handle synonyms and related terms automatically
3. WHEN ranking results THEN the system SHALL prioritize relevance based on semantic similarity and source authority
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL highlight relevant text snippets that match the query intent
5. IF the query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL provide query suggestions or clarifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and responsive search interface, so that I can easily search and browse results on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the search engine THEN the system SHALL display a clean, Google-like interface
2. WHEN using the interface on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a fully responsive design
3. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL display results in a clear, scannable format
4. WHEN loading search results THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and loading states
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage trusted source configurations, so that I can add, remove, or update the list of approved sources for indexing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring sources THEN the system SHALL maintain a whitelist of approved domains and APIs
2. WHEN adding new sources THEN the system SHALL validate source authority and reliability
3. WHEN sources are updated THEN the system SHALL re-index content from modified sources
4. WHEN sources become unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and log issues
5. IF a source violates trust criteria THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to remove it from indexing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the search engine to have robust indexing capabilities, so that content from trusted sources is regularly updated and searchable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN indexing content THEN the system SHALL extract text, metadata, and structure from trusted sources
2. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt and rate limiting for each source
3. WHEN content is updated at the source THEN the system SHALL detect and re-index changes within 24 hours
4. WHEN indexing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN storing indexed content THEN the system SHALL maintain source attribution and original URLs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast search response times, so that I can quickly find the information I need without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a search query THEN the system SHALL return results within 500ms for cached queries
2. WHEN executing complex semantic searches THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times through proper scaling
4. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for large result sets
5. IF response times exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want search result quality that rivals commercial search engines, so that I can trust the relevance and ranking of results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ranking search results THEN the system SHALL use advanced algorithms considering relevance, authority, and freshness
2. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL implement NLP techniques for better understanding
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show the most relevant results first
4. WHEN evaluating source authority THEN the system SHALL weight results based on source credibility scores
5. WHEN handling duplicate content THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and show the most authoritative version
